📕  Get_Next_line:  

Get_Next_Line (GNL) is a project from the second milestone of the common core at 42 School.
The goal is to display, line by line, the content received from a file descriptor.
One of the most challenging aspects is to avoid memory leaks when dynamically allocating memory.

🚀 To get the source code of the functions:

➡️ In the terminal go in the folder where you want to install the functions.

To create the folder: mkdir Folder_Name

To go in the folder:  cd Folder_NAme

To ensure that we are in the good folder:  pwd and you will see a path like: /home//Desktop/Folder_Name

➡️ Download the source code in your folder with this command:
